    <!--meta> Hi iBec folks! A few caveats -
    A more thorough approach would have included a seperate
    database and used an XML file to pre-populate the map with favorite/best
    restaurants, or created a function that saved all restaurants that
    the user searches for and allows them to add their own notes etc, however
    that was beyond the scope of this project. </meta-->
